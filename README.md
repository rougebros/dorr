# DORR: Building Bridges to Harmony  

## Introduction  

What happens when human interactions, needs, and experiences are scattered across different platforms?

When every platform—social media, marketplaces, rating systems, and to-do lists—operates in isolation?

🚀 **DORR (Definitions of Ranked Rates)** aims to unify these scattered elements into a structured framework.

It transforms **thoughts, needs, and actions** into organized, visual, and collaborative journeys—**using color-coded categories, decentralized ratings, and AI-assisted workflows.**

But **DORR** is more than just a tool—**it’s a living framework, a unified and nonlinear language that enables people (and AI) to rank, organize, and collaborate with meaning.**

It’s **an open-source, evolving ecosystem** where human and AI interactions **aren't just stored but structured**—bridging the past, present, and future, whether **among communities, friends, LLMs or even between different versions of the self**.

## **Why DORR?**  

In today's digital world, people struggle with **fragmented tools** that don’t integrate well:  
- **E-commerce and service platforms focus only on transactions.**  
- **Social media amplifies voices but lacks structured action.**  
- **Task management tools are isolated from real-world needs.**  
- **Ratings and recommendations are centralized and impersonal.**  

💡 **DORR solves these problems by bringing structure to every experience**—organizing them through colors, categories, and real-world mappings.

## **Dorr’s Flow in Poetry**   
```
حال خونین دلان، که گوید زار؟ 🩸
🩸 @Who speaks out for the voiceless bleeding hearts?

که گوید راز؟ 👑👹
👑👹 @Who unveils the hidden truth (Gods/Foes)?

که گوید کار؟ 💜
💜 @Who shares the steps of action?  

وز فلک، خون جمع، که جوید کار؟ 💙
💙 And from the heavens above, @Who commits in taking action?  

که جوید نام؟ 💚
💚 @Who restores their name in completing the action?  

که جوید شاد؟ 🔆
🔆 @Who finds joy in seeing their request fulfilled?  
```
📌 **This poetic structure reflects Dorr’s system**—where pain turns into thought, thought into promise, promise into action, and action into meaningful impact.

## **What is DORR? – A Quick Overview**  

*"Is Dorr just another e-commerce platform?"*  
*"A job marketplace? A map?"*  
*"Another rating system?"*  
*"Another task management tool?"*  
*"Is it a social media tool?"*  
*"Just an AI-powered assistant?"*  

**Dorr is none of these alone, but all of them together in a structured way.**  

📦 **If you think it’s just e-commerce…**  
Dorr **flips the supply-demand model**: Instead of suppliers pushing products, needs and pains define what must be created, supplied, or solved.

📦 **If you think it’s just a job marketplace…**  
Dorr structures **service-based interactions** just as easily as selling goods—whether it’s **requesting a doctor, a driver, food, a hotel, a cleaner, a plumber, or even community aid.**  

📦 **If you think it’s just a rating system…**  
Unlike **5-star ratings** that lack context, Dorr **simplifies rating input** and makes ranking **dynamic and category-based:**  
- Users **only rate with REGRET (🩸) or RELIEF (🔆)**—no need to overthink between **1⭐ or 5⭐.**  
- **View rates with dynamic A-F rankings** instead of a **meaningless global average like 4.8⭐.**  
- **Each service is ranked by relevant categories**—for example:  
  - A plumber might have **A for timeliness, C for pricing, B for quality.**  
  - A restaurant might be ranked separately for **hygiene, service speed, and taste.**  
  - A business could have **A in innovation but D in ethical practices.**  
- **Rankings adapt dynamically based on:**  
  - **Circles** (personal, trusted, public) → A service can be **A-ranked in one circle but D-ranked in another**, reflecting different experiences across networks.  
  - **Time relevance** (past, recent, current) → Ratings **aren't frozen in time**—a high rank from years ago doesn’t mean the service is still great today, and vice versa.  
  - **Service type** (what actually matters in each category) → Instead of one **overall meaningless score**, rankings are based on **specific factors relevant to that service.**  
- **A-F ranks are based on % of reliefs vs. regrets within a circle:**  
  - The **highest relief % in a circle is set as A (100%)**, and others are ranked **relative to that max score.**  
  - Example: If **Bob has the highest relief % (60%) in one circle,** he is **A**, and someone with 50% becomes **B**.  
  - But if Bob rank is viewed in a circle where **90% is the highest, his 60% may now be a C.**  
  - This **pushes competition for progress** while keeping ratings **meaningful and comparative within different circles.**  
- **No manipulated averages**—**you control whose ratings you see and what criteria matter most.**  

📦 **If you think it’s just a map…**  
Unlike static review maps like Google or Yelp, Dorr’s map updates **dynamically—highlighting urgent needs (🔴), available services (🔆), and community-driven rankings (A-F) in real time.**

📦 **If you think it’s just a to-do app…**  
Dorr **isn’t just about managing tasks—it structures commitments, tracks progress, and ranks actions transparently.**  

- **Color-coded states** → Tasks flow from **thoughts (💜) to promises (💙) to completed actions (💚).**  
- **Color-coded @WHO** → Identify key roles in action:  
  - **🔴@ Who suffers?**—raising awareness of pains.  
  - **👑/👹 @Who reveals or hides?**—gods, foes, or key influences.  
  - **🟣@ Who plans?**—sharing next steps or strategies.  
  - **🔵@ Who commits?**—taking responsibility for execution.  
  - **🟢@ Who delivers?**—fulfilling promises.  
  - **🟡@ Who benefits?**—gaining relief, joy, or resolution.  
- **⏳ Colorful Hourglasses** → Track time dynamically across past, present, and future, categorized by meaningful Dorr colors.
- **📋 Colorful Checklists** → Organize tasks visually for **clarity, collaboration, and execution.**  
- **🔔 Colorful Notifications** → **Unlike traditional notifications,** Dorr flips the way updates are received—**bringing meaning, color, and full customization to alerts based on what truly matters:**  
  - **🔴🔔 Pain Alerts** → Get notified of **urgent issues, struggles, or crises.**  
    - *Example:* **🔴🔔 for #stray_cats** alerts you when new reports appear in your circle (e.g., an injured stray, urgent medical need).  
  - **🟡🔔 Needs & Requests** → Get updates on **new requests or open opportunities.**  
    - *Example:* **🟡🔔 for #transport_truck** notifies you when someone needs a truck.  
  - **🟣🔔 Thoughts & Discussions** → Stay informed about **new ideas, proposals, or evolving plans.**  
    - *Example:* **🟣🔔 for #urban_planning** alerts you when a new city project proposal is discussed.  
  - **🔵🔔 Task Assignments & Commitments** → Get notified when a task is assigned to you.  
    - *Example:* **🔵🔔 for #plumber_jobs** lets you know when a plumbing request is assigned.  
  - **🟢🔔 Task Completion & Achievements** → See updates when an action is **verified or marked as done.**  
    - *Example:* **🟢🔔 for #delivery_orders** alerts you when an order is completed.  
  - **🟠🔔 Gods👑, Foes👹 & Key Influences** → Get notified when major figures or authorities engage in a topic.  
    - *Example:* **🟠👑🔔 for #housing** alerts you when **a landlord, tenant association, or legal expert is found in circles.**  


📦 **If you think it’s social media…**  
Dorr **doesn’t replace platforms—it integrates and structures social feeds** into meaningful categories, all in one place.  

📦 **If you think it’s just AI automation…**  
Dorr **uses AI to structure information**—organizing tasks, voice inputs, and user interactions into **a meaningful, shareable format.**

## **How DORR Works**  

### **1️⃣ Color-Coded System: A Unified Experience**  

DORR’s **rating manifest** and **notification system** share the same **six colors**, making updates intuitive and meaningful:  

- 🩸 **Red** → Pains, regrets, or urgent alerts.  
- 🔆 **Yellow** → Needs, opportunities, or highlights.  
- 💜 **Purple** → Thoughts, questions, or next steps.  
- 💙 **Blue** → Assignments, commitments, or task updates.  
- 💚 **Green** → Completed actions, achievements, or milestones.  
- 🟠 **Orange** → Recognized Gods 👑 (Guiding entities), Foes 👹 (Shameful entities).  

**And Everything is structured through those colors:**  
🌱 **#Hashtags** to categorize topics.  
🎨 **@tags** to track different WHO.  
🎨 **Checklists** for organized progress.  
🎨 **% Ratings** for decentralized ranking.  
🎨 **⏳ Time tracking** for structured timelines.  
🎨 **🔔 Notifications** to keep things actionable.  
🎨 **📍 Location mapping** to visualize real-world impact.  

This **creates an intuitive feedback loop** where **user ratings and notifications follow the same structured meaning.**  

### **2️⃣ A Journey in Colors**  

1️⃣ **Express Freely** → Enter thoughts, needs, or experiences as text, voice, or chat.  
2️⃣ **Receive Clarity** → AI structures inputs into **colors and categories** for easy tracking.  
3️⃣ **Act Meaningfully** → Use maps, tasks, and reminders to **turn ideas into reality.**  
4️⃣ **Evolve** → Continuously refine and build a **clearer view of your world.**
