# DORR: Ratings Beyond Stars

## Introduction

**DORR** *(Definitions of Recurring Ranked Rates)* aims to shift away from the conventional **five-star rating systems** to a more meaningful and customizable ranking model. 

DORR provides dynamic, customizable, colorful rates representing different behaviours. With the power to connect via multiple options (e.g., Bluetooth, innovative P2P, LoRa, Torr, WebRTC, centralized servers, etc), DORR promotes a human-centered way of expressing experiences.


## Why DORR?

#### A Wise Man Once Said:
"A *truly happy & fortunate person* is one who **values the experiences of others**—both positive and negative. 
If we all learn from each other's experiences, the failures in our lives wouldn't be so abundant."

The current rating systems often fail to capture the complexity of human experiences, reducing nuanced feedback to a single, aggregated star rating. 


## Value Proposition

"DORR redefines C2C and C2B interactions, moving beyond star rating system to empower people and communities to share experiences or needs. With 6 vibrant colors for tags, hashtags, and notifications, DORR also aims to flip supply-demand chain to demand-supply approach, allowing open and fewer connections on what truly matters to them—to minimizing middlemen."


## Purpose and Mission

DORR's mission is to empower people to share and learn from each other’s experiences with a focus on transparency, mutual support, and independence from traditional platform-centric models. By giving users full control over what they share and how they connect—without intermediaries dictating terms—DORR fosters a community-driven environment where insights, needs, and offers are exchanged directly.


## A Unique Perspective on Sharing

In DORR, each tag or experience is more than just a data point; it’s a piece of wisdom, highlighted with meaningful color-coding that adds layers of insight and clarity. By organizing hashtags and notifications with a color-coded approach, DORR enables people to see what matters in vivid clarity—whether it’s an urgent need, an opportunity, or a supportive presence within the community.

## The Path Forward

Inspired by the model of Unix, which grew organically as a collaborative tool, DORR aims to establish itself as an open-source platform that benefits both individuals and communities. Like Unix’s open framework, DORR’s structure allows flexibility, transparency, and room for meaningful user-generated evolution. Although it’s free to use, DORR sustains itself by generating true, lasting value—connecting people who genuinely benefit from each other’s shared experiences without the need for profit-driven motives.

# How DORR Works

## 6 Colorful Rates
![DORR Rates](src/files/media/dorr-video.gif)

DORR is built on the idea of using a **rich, expressive ranking system** instead of the limiting five-star ratings. Ratings are ongoing, dynamic, and represent a wider array of experiences.

1. **Capturing the Experience**: Select a POV, assign meaningful hashtags, and use colored rates to represent pains, gains, or other facets of the experience.
2. **Customizable Connections**: Whether you’re using innovative P2P technologies, Bluetooth, or other communication methods, you can connect to multiple networks, broadcast, or receive ratings—all within a single app.
3. **Recurring Interactions**: Instead of leaving experiences rated once, users can continuously update the status of an interaction as it evolves.
4. **Tasks & Chats**: Keeping these two items next to each other is a must for any team or project.
